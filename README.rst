hocho = hot chocolate, but for people who have better things to do with their time than stumble over four syllables when two will do nicely.  Me?  Iâ€™m going to do something awesome with all the time I save by cutting out those two extraneous syllables.  Like maybe snow tubing or eating ice cream.  Or both at once.

Deep Dive
=========

``hocho`` is the main command.  It has several subcommands that allows us to do some magical things.

stir : subcommand
    takes one argument:
        filename: the name of the file you are going to create
    flags:
        -s, --styles: tells hocho to create a style file.
    example:
        hocho stir material.styl -s

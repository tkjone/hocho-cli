hocho = hot chocolate, but for people who have better things to do with their time than stumble over four syllables when two will do nicely.  Me?  Iâ€™m going to do something awesome with all the time I save by cutting out those two extraneous syllables.  Like maybe snow tubing or eating ice cream.  Or both at once.

Purpose
=======

Hocho is going to save you some time.  Don't worry about creating files and directories for your projects anymore.  Let hocho do it for you!

Installation
============

.. code-block::

    pip install git+https://github.com/tkjone/hocho-cli.git

Usage
=====

How do I learn about hocho?  Try typing in ``hocho --help``

.. code-block::

    Options:
       --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
        stir

Deep Dive
=========

``hocho`` is the main command.  It has several subcommands that allows us to do some magical things.

stir : subcommand
    When you run ``hocho stir`` you will be prompted with one question at this moment.  Press enter and you are asked to create a file name.  The result is that hocho will create a ``[name].styl`` file.  This file is created in whichever directory you are currently in.

More to come.

Thanks
======

I want to give a special thank you to Anya Craig who helped me with the ideation for this project!  hocho would not exist without you!
